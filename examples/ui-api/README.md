# UI and API Example

A small Plugin API v1 reference with a real declarative page, a `display_mode`
settings section and a **Read library** action returning up to 50 current-user
games. It requests `games.read`, `plugin.settings` and `frontend.navigation.main`.
The host owns permission classification and supplies authenticated gateway context.
The entrypoint reports ready and remains supervised instead of exiting after
startup requests. No plugin JavaScript is loaded by the native host.

Use it as the minimal structure in the [author guide](../../docs/plugin-author-guide.md).
Build/test with `pytest` and `python tools/build_packages.py`; inspect the isolated
`.validation/` distribution. New packages include this README, an icon, tags and
release-specific update metadata. Release signing requires a registered publisher.
