"""Generates the auto-created Prestige challenge for a card, once its
game's achievements are fully unlocked. The card side never lets a user
type or pick this challenge — this is the only source for what a
Prestige challenge actually is, and it always comes from real per-game
data rather than being invented per call.

Signals are checked in priority order, each one a real fact about the
game rather than a guess:
  1. `tier == 'missable'` achievements — the one genuinely
     provider-verified difficulty signal this app has (RetroAchievements
     only). The challenge is to earn them all in a single blind run.
  2. Tags/features naming a genre with an established permadeath/no-death
     convention (roguelike, souls-like).
Falls back to a small, fixed catalog of well-known challenge-run
archetypes, picked deterministically from the game's own id — stable
across regenerations, never re-rolled, never chosen by a person."""
